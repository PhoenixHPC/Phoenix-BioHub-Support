In fact, stem cells therapies have been the sizzling hot topic for the last decade within academic cycles. Current research and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.centerwatch.com/clinical-trials/listings/condition/467/stem-cell-transplant&quot;&gt;clinical trails in stem cell therapies&lt;/a&gt; are extremely active and have shown some dramatic improvements and convincing evidence particular in Neurodegeneration diseases like &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/07/090720190726.htm&quot;&gt; Alzheimer’s disease&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/imj.12944/abstract&quot;&gt;multiple sclerosis&lt;/a&gt;; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bbc.com/news/health-22646103&quot;&gt;Brain and spinal cord injury&lt;/a&gt;;

&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The public enthusiasm about stem cell therapy is even more dramatic but has a clear sign of overheating, which is arguably fuelled by many &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.au/search?q=stemcell&amp;amp;source=univ&amp;amp;tbm=shop&amp;amp;tbo=u&amp;amp;sa=X&amp;amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwm5nDpojVAhXHgLwKHdAZCGwQsxgIKQ&amp;amp;biw=1393&amp;amp;bih=803&quot;&gt;stem-cell-based consumable products&lt;/a&gt;. Worryingly, hardly any of those consumable products are backed up by any clinical evidence. Many of those are simply non-evidence based promising and purely driven by economical incentives to capitalise on public hot topics. Due to high potentials of pluripotent stem cells, the risks associated with stem cell therapy are also high, particular when handled with uncontrolled manner. The consequences can be extremely severe, numerous fatal accidents have been reported in all &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/hallmarks-of-quack-medicine-in-fatal-stem-cell-treatment/7630288&quot;&gt;Australia&lt;/a&gt;,  &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/hallmarks-of-quack-medicine-in-fatal-stem-cell-treatment/7630288&quot;&gt;UK&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.foxnews.com/health/2017/07/25/dozens-us-clinics-sell-unproven-stem-cell-therapies-for-heart-failure.html&quot;&gt;The States&lt;/a&gt;.

All those accidents have demonstrated the relaxed regulation scheme in stem cell therapies can be extremely harmful and the circumstances need to be changed.

Will this be the future of biomedical research? An organoid is a miniaturized and simplified version of an organ produced &lt;em&gt;in vitro&lt;/em&gt; in three dimensions that shows realistic micro-anatomy. They are derived from one or a few cells from a tissue, embryonic stem cells or induced pluripotent stem cells, which can self-organize in three-dimensional culture owing to their self-renewal and differentiation capacities. The technolgy in growing organoids is rapidly developing since 2010s, which makes organoids a valiable research tool in understading developmental biology and accelrating personalised medicine. Yet, ethical implications can be hard to measure. Although there is no embryos used in the organoids creatation, questions have been placed on whether organoids are materially different from a human embryo?
