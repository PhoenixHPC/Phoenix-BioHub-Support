Is your code complex and have a lot of dependencies? Are you frastrated by the fact that your code
is not compiling and complaining about the version conflict? This is the situation you will need the
support of a contained environment. 
&lt;br /&gt;
Containers have a simple goal in mind, that is to
isolate an application and its dependencies into a self-contained unit that can run anywhere
regardless of hardware and shell environment etc. Form this perspective, VMs serves a similar
function, which you may be more familier. Nevertheless, container is regarded as superior approach
compare to VM, which removes the needs for physical hardware emulator and have performance
superiority.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
To understand why container is more superior, we have to understand more about architectural
underline the container and VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;===Virtual Machines===
A VM is essentially an emulation of a physical computer and the execution of applications follows
the same procedures as a physical computer would. This is because VMs run on top of a physical
machine using a layer so called “hypervisor” or “virtual machine monitor” (VMM). A “hypervisor” is a
piece of software, firmware and
hardware emulator bundle that run directly on physical computers (which is called &lt;strong&gt;host machine&lt;/strong&gt;
under this context). The &lt;strong&gt;host machine&lt;/strong&gt; provides physical resources like RAM and CPU etc.
Hypervisors present the guest operating systems with a
virtual operating platform and manages the execution of the guest operating systems. The
resources provided by the &lt;strong&gt;host machine&lt;/strong&gt; can be divided and distributed and multiple instances of
a variety of operating systems may share the distributed resources after virtualisation by
hypervisors. The name &lt;strong&gt;hypervisor&lt;/strong&gt;  also reflects its nature as a controller of the operating
system &lt;em&gt;kernel&lt;/em&gt;, where &lt;strong&gt;hyper&lt;/strong&gt; is a stronger term
than &lt;em&gt;super&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;strong&gt;hypervisor&lt;/strong&gt; is translated as the &lt;strong&gt;supervisor&lt;/strong&gt; of the &lt;strong&gt;supervisor&lt;/strong&gt;. (If you
are interested in the incarnation of term &lt;strong&gt;hypervisor&lt;/strong&gt;, you may find following two items
intersting: &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.google.com.au/url?sa=t&amp;amp;rct=j&amp;amp;q=&amp;amp;esrc=s&amp;amp;source=web&amp;amp;cd=3&amp;amp;cad=rja&amp;amp;uact=8&amp;amp;ved=

Katzan, 1970&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.amazon.de/Analysis-Major-Computer-Operating-Systems/dp/B00B06YA18&quot;&gt;a book by
Clinton McIntosh,
1970&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
A VM contains both the applications (i.e. the part you will be interested as
bioinformatician) and whatever the supports are required to run that application (e.g. system
binaries and varies dependency libraries). In addition, a VM also carries an entire
virtualised hardware stack of its own (e.g. virtualised CPU, network adaptors and storage) VM is a
fully fledged guest operating system with its own dedicated resources (virtualised from host
machine’s distribution). VM can run on &lt;strong&gt;host machine&lt;/strong&gt; in one of two modes: as a &lt;em&gt;hosted
hypervisor__ or as a &lt;strong&gt;bare-metal hypervisor&lt;/strong&gt;. They are fundamentally different. 
====Hosted Hypervisor====
A _hosted hypervisor&lt;/em&gt; runs through the operating sstem of the &lt;em&gt;host machine&lt;/em&gt;. The benefit of a
&lt;em&gt;hosted hypervisor&lt;/em&gt; is largely sweep away the importance of the underlying hardware, this is due to
the fact that the host operating system is handling the hardware communications. Therefore the
&lt;em&gt;hosted hypervisor&lt;/em&gt; is useful in the situation where the hardware compatibility is high on the
priority list. On the flip side, &lt;em&gt;hosted hypervisor&lt;/em&gt; inevitably invert an additional layer between
hardware and application, the consequences can be more resource overhead and result a resource
hungry application, lower VM performace.&lt;br /&gt;
====Bare-metal Hypervisor====
Contrary to &lt;em&gt;hosted hypervisor&lt;/em&gt;, a &lt;em&gt;bare metal hypervisor&lt;/em&gt; environment improves performance by
directly run on host machine’s hardware. In turn, a &lt;em&gt;bare-metal hypervisor&lt;/em&gt; needs its own operating
system and own device drivers to be able to interact with underline hardware (e.g. I/O, kernel
processes etc.). Therefore &lt;em&gt;bare-metal hypervisor&lt;/em&gt; can perform better, have better scalability and
enhanced stability. Nevertheless, this also comes a cost of compatibility given that only limited
device drivers can be implemented at a single time.&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
In summary, although VM contains everything we need to run an application (bioinformatics
application) and is independent to certain degree, it also need to compromise either performance or
compatibility.&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;===Containers===
If you are a programmer or have been tech nerd, you may have already heard of Docker. Docker is a
helpful tools for packaging, shipping and running applications within “containers”. It is somewhat
important to have a mindful understanding about Docker and its counterparts.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="phoenix" /><category term="intermediate" /><category term="coding" /><summary type="html">==Preface== Is your code complex and have a lot of dependencies?

  &lt;p&gt;RSS/Atom feed icon (like the one featured in this post) may look very familier, do you ever wondered
why so many websites have it and what they are there for? In this post update, we will spend a bit
of time to talk about the technology behind those “WIFI” like icons and how we can use them to keep
up with news feed we are insteasted. 
&lt;br /&gt;
RSS stands for Rich Site Summary but probabliy more commonly known as Really Simple Syndication,
which is a type of web feed that allows browser to access updates in a more prompt fashion through a
standard format. One particular benifit of RSS is to allow news contents from multiple sources to be
accessed in a centralised platform. In addition, RSS is also benfitial if you want to keep tracking
event developments, RSS is actively checking for new content at backstage and organising news post
in chronological order. Atom is an alternative format that provides very similar feed functions as
per RSS-2.0, although the technical details vary between the two, whereas Atom in general is a more
robust and feature-rich approach than RSS-2.0. In case you are curious, Phoenix@BioHub proudly
supports Atom-v1.0 with autodiscovery functionality (i.e. you may already find your rss aggregator
picked up the feed channel from this site, and this is the reason. If you wonder what is feed
aggregator, then keep reading). 
&lt;br /&gt;
RSS feeds are commonly delivered via XML file format, however XML is not a user-friendly format for
human daily readings. Fortunately, we can access the feed via various news aggregator, which
provides all the functionalities we mentioned above including tracking, aggregating and news
notification etc.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;blockquote&gt;
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;If you are on a Mac and using Safari as your browser, you can click on the feed icon on the top
right coner or on the botton of this page to subscribe to this webpage to get all the updates once
new content arrives. If you need &lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2014/11/03/subscribe-rss-feeds-safari-os-x/&quot;&gt;a step-by-step

&lt;a href=&quot;http://osxdaily.com/2014/11/03/subscribe-rss-feeds-safari-os-x/&quot;&gt;this&lt;/a&gt; helps.&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;For the users using Google Chrome, you may need to install a feed aggregator plug-in, like &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp?
hl=en&quot;&gt;“RSS Feed Reader”&lt;/a&gt;. There are many available similar plug-ins on &lt;a href=&quot;https://chrome.google.com/webstore/search/feed?hl=en&quot;&gt;chrome web

Nevertheless, it is a good idea to avoid excessive use of longq. One is because the long wall-time processes are vulnerable during system/node down time; long wall-time tasks also take longer for a scheduler to reserve appropriate resources (i.e. longer, sometimes substantial longer waiting time). Instead, a recommended approach would be either adopting “divide and conquer” strategy or implementing “checkpoints” for your pipeline (many software already provides such a function, just a matter of enabling). Checkpoints in short provides a snapshot of the application status, which can be used to reconfigure the application and restore the process from where left off. Phoenix Team is actively developing a system wide implementation of checkpoint, which in turn will automatically checkpoint the running jobs and provide an opportunity to automatically resubmit jobs once hard wall-time has been reached.

Nevertheless, it is a good idea to avoid excessive use of longq. One is because the long wall-time processes are vulnerable during system/node down time; long wall-time tasks also take longer for a scheduler to reserve appropriate resources (i.e. longer, sometimes substantial longer waiting time). Instead, a recommended approach would be either adopting “divide and conquer” strategy or implementing “checkpoints” for your pipeline (many software already provides such a function, just a matter of enabling).
