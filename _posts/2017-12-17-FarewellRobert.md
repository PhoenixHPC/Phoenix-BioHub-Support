### Robert is saying GoodBye

Robert from Phoenix Team is sadly saying so long. It has been a privilege to see and work with
amazing, talented guys/girls like yourself @ BioHub, thank you for allowing me to be a part of your life for the last
8 months or so. In the future, Phoenix team will be continuously work with you and delivering more advanced computing technology for bioinformaticians/researchers at the University of Adelaide. 
Enquires regarding to Phoenix/HPC, please address your questions to <a
href="mailto:hpcsupport@adelaide.edu.au">Contact HPC Support</a> and one of Phoenix Team member will
be more than happy to help you. <br><br>
This will also be the last offical post of Phoenix@BioHub, I would like to take this opportunity to thank many people, particularly **Steve**, **Jimmy**, **Rick** and
**wonderful students**, you together made my life @ BioHub a challenging yet enjoyable, I did
sincerely love every single day. I do not know what else I should say by now, I thought before I officially signing off, I may be share this my favourite muppets scene with you "Saying Goodbye". <br><br>
So long and wish you luck. <br><br>
Kind Regards <br>
Robert
