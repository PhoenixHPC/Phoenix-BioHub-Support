> RSS/Atom feed icon (like the one featured in this post) may look very familier, do you ever wondered
why so many websites have it and what they are there for? In this post update, we will spend a bit
of time to talk about the technology behind those "WIFI" like icons and how we can use them to keep
up with news feed we are insteasted. 
\\
> RSS stands for Rich Site Summary but probabliy more commonly known as Really Simple Syndication,
which is a type of web feed that allows browser to access updates in a more prompt fashion through a
standard format. One particular benifit of RSS is to allow news contents from multiple sources to be
accessed in a centralised platform. In addition, RSS is also benfitial if you want to keep tracking
event developments, RSS is actively checking for new content at backstage and organising news post
in chronological order. Atom is an alternative format that provides very similar feed functions as
per RSS-2.0, although the technical details vary between the two, whereas Atom in general is a more
robust and feature-rich approach than RSS-2.0. In case you are curious, Phoenix@BioHub proudly
supports Atom-v1.0 with autodiscovery functionality (i.e. you may already find your rss aggregator
picked up the feed channel from this site, and this is the reason. If you wonder what is feed
aggregator, then keep reading). 
\\
> RSS feeds are commonly delivered via XML file format, however XML is not a user-friendly format for
human daily readings. Fortunately, we can access the feed via various news aggregator, which
provides all the functionalities we mentioned above including tracking, aggregating and news
notification etc.

right coner or on the botton of this page to subscribe to this webpage to get all the updates once
new content arrives. If you need [a step-by-step

> > * For the users using Google Chrome, you may need to install a feed aggregator plug-in, like [RSS
Feed
Reader](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/rss-feed-reader/pnjaodmkngahhkoihejjehlcdlnohgmp?
hl=en). There are many available similar plug-ins on [chrome web
