#### This post is for the workshop "Introduction to Phoenix for Bioinformaticians" on 28th September 

In this workshop, the Phoenix team will introduce the most powerful **High Performance Computing** (HPC) facility **Phoenix** in the state. We will cover some basics about HPC in general. As Linux runs on almost all the **High Performance Computing** (HPC) facilities around the globe, this workshop will provid you a
stepping stone to get into the HPC field. In this workshop, we will forcus on some of the most frequently used terminal commands in Linux and experiment with scripting. So without further do, let's get underway
