__This post is for the workshop "Introduction to Phoenix for Bioinformaticians" on 28th September__
 
In this workshop, the Phoenix team will introduce world class and the state's most powerful _High
Performance Computing_ (HPC) facility _Phoenix_. We will cover some basics about HPC
in general, particularly we will introduce fundamentals of scheduling. 

The aim of this workshop is to provide you a stepping stone to get started with Phoenix. In addition
to the informative lecture, you will also have opportunities to hand on some real examples and try
to submit your first jobs to Phoenix. 

__Before we dive in, please ensure you have an account on Phoenix. If you are unsure, please check
