On the 27th September, during the semester break, the Phoenix team will
run the inaugural "Taste and Conquest the Linux". This will be the
stepping stone course to get into the high performance computing. If you
wonder how command line works and want to know a little bit more about
how super computer works, we are highly recommended this one to you. The
registration and more information will be coming weeks, please look out
for your emails or watch out this space. 
<br><br>
All the best for the time being.
